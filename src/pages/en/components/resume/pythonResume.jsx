                I am a skilled Python web developer with a focus on the Django framework
                and Django REST Framework, utilizing className-based views to create
                efficient, maintainable, and scalable web applications. I have
                experience in integrating native Python functions into web environments,
                leveraging the power of Python to deliver high-quality web services.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">
                My expertise includes unit and integration testing with Pytest and
                Unittest, ensuring the reliability and stability of the applications I
                develop. I am familiar with the drf-yasg library, allowing for automatic
                generation of API documentation to facilitate seamless collaboration
                with team members and external stakeholders.

                As a proficient user of data analysis libraries such as NumPy and
                Pandas, I can efficiently process and manipulate large datasets, adding
                value to the projects I work on. My background in PostgreSQL enables me
                to design and maintain robust database systems that support the
                requirements of complex web applications.

                I am experienced in creating advanced queries and managing data using
                Django&apos;s ORM and custom Managers, optimizing the performance and
                flexibility of the applications I develop. Additionally, I am
                knowledgeable in other Django ecosystem libraries, such as Celery for
                asynchronous task management and Django Channels for real-time
                communication, further expanding the possibilities of the projects I
                contribute to.
            </p>
            <p>
                By combining my Python expertise, Django experience, and dedication to
                best practices, I am confident in my ability to create high-quality web
                applications tailored to the needs of any project.
