                (QA), proficient in Python, Java, and C#. My expertise includes
                utilizing design patterns such as the Page Object Model and Screenplay
                to create efficient and maintainable test automation solutions. With a
                keen eye for detail and strong analytical abilities, I excel in
                debugging and identifying software errors.

                Cypress, Selenium, Cucumber, Gherkin, JUnit, NUnit, Pytest, Serenity,
                and more. Additionally, I have experience with mobile device automation

                contribute to the development of automation frameworks, while upholding
                testing principles and concepts. I adhere to agile methodologies and
                best practices and remain mindful of the software development lifecycle
